# Static Notion Favicon

When you set an icon for a page on [Notion](https://www.notion.so) it will
automatically update the favicon (i.e., the little icon in your browser tab) to
the icon for the page whenever you visit it.

This addon always displays the default Notion favicon instead of switching the
favicon to the icon of the currently activated page.

This addon is publised here:

## TODOs

- The addon currently works by just setting the favicon to the default Notion
  favicon every 3 seconds, without checking if the favicon actually changed. It
  could probably be made more efficient, for example, by just having it
  triggered when the favicon actually changes.

- Create an icon for this addon.
